# Obstacle-Avoider-Arduino
BLUETOOTH CONTROLLED OBSTACLE AVOIDER USING ARDUINO

Bluetooth Controlled Obstacle Avoider is a robot car integrated with an Arduino Board, Bluetooth Module, and Ultrasonic Sensors to get the information from the surrounding area and avoid any obstacle collisions.

This Project has three features: 
1- Obstacle Avoider using the Arduino Board.
2- Bluetooth Controlled Obstacle Avoider using the Arduino Board, the Bluetooth Module, and an Android Application.
3- Voice Controlled Robotic Car using the Arduino Board, the Bluetooth Module, and an Android Application.
